This course will start at 9am Pacific Time and will run until 5pm Pacific Time. Its format will be a combination of
several interactive Zoom sessions and pre-recorded reading and video materials in-between the Zoom sessions. Course
materials will be added here shortly before the start of the course.

This course is a general introduction to the main principles of parallel programming, using Chapel programming language
to illustrate the basic concepts and ideas. Chapel is a relatively new language for both shared- and distributed-memory
programming, with easy-to-use, high-level abstractions for both task and data parallelism that make it ideal for
learning parallel programming for a novice HPC user. Chapel is incredibly intuitive, striving to merge the ease-of-use
of Python and the performance of traditional compiled languages such as C and Fortran. Parallel constructs that
typically take tens of lines of MPI code can be expressed in only a few lines of Chapel code. Chapel is open source and
can run on any Unix-like operating system, with hardware support from laptops to large HPC systems.

**Prerequisites:** working knowledge of the Linux Bash shell and familiarity with HPC cluster environment.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in order to
participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers SSH is
usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
