This course will start at 9am Pacific Time and will run until 5pm Pacific Time. Its format will be a combination of
several interactive Zoom sessions and pre-recorded reading and video materials in-between the Zoom sessions. Course
materials will be added here shortly before the start of the course.

We will study 3D scientific visualization with ParaView, an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users can
interactively visualize 2D and 3D data sets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles,
animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive (GUI)
and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and is an easy and fun tool to learn.

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no prior visualization experience is required.

**Software**: Please [install ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download) on your computer, and make sure you can start
it before the course. We will provide all sample data and codes for the exercises. Let us know before or during the
course if you want to load your own dataset into ParaView.
