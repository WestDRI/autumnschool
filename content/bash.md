This is a hands-on introduction to the Linux command line and the interaction with a remote server. This course mixes
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) materials with WestGrid's custom training.

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no previous experience is required. We will provide
guest accounts to one of our Linux systems.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in
order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux
computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
