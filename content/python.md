This introductory course will walk you through the basics of programming in Python. We will cover the main language
features -- variables and data types, conditionals, lists, for/while loops, list comprehensions, dictionaries, writing
functions -- as well as working with external libraries such as numpy (mathematical arrays), pandas (data frames), and
matplotlib (basic plotting).

**Prerequisites:** none.

**Software**: We will be using online Jupyter notebooks, so no need to install Python on your computer.
