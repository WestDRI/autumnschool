This course is an introduction to High-Performance Computing on Compute Canada clusters.

**Prerequisites:** working knowledge of the Linux Bash shell. We will provide guest accounts to one of our Linux systems.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in order to
participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers SSH is
usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
